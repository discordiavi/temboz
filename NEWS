* Changes in Temboz 0.7.1 (2005-11-01).

** fixed buggy handling of feeds without links or GUIDs (reported by
   Peter Janes)

** started adding context-sensitive help by linking to the CVStrac Wiki

** Transforms can change item links to point to full contents rather than
   a teaser

** improved error reporting on autodiscovery

** the feed title in view now links to feed details page rather than to the
   feed home directly

** added catch-up link to feed details page

** More ad filtering out of the box

** the feed info page now does a full dump of feedparser's output, to help
   write filtering rules


* Changes in Temboz 0.7 (2005-09-12).

* Changes in Temboz 0.6 (unreleased).

** improved navigation and cross-browser compatibility

** articles flagged as uninteresting and older than 6 months (default setting)
   are removed from the database (enhanced in 0.7)

* Changes in Temboz 0.5 (2005-02-06).

** Automatic database backups daily

** The database tracks the GUID and link separately, so it handles feeds where
   the two differ correctly (suggested by Georg Bauer).

** Feeds can be flagged as private. They won't be listed in OPML exports if
   they are marked private.

** Some feeds have duplicate articles with identical titles but different
   permalinks or GUIDs (e.g. Reuters). You can now optionally flag a feed as
   requiring title-based duplicate detection and removal.
